# Inventory-Management-System-with-Json
This project is an Inventory Management System developed using Python and JSON. It enables efficient management of inventory data, including adding new products, purchasing items, and recording sales transactions.

## Features

Add Items to Inventory: Admins can add new products to the inventory. If a product already exists, its quantity can be updated.
Purchase Products: Users can purchase items based on product IDs. The system checks for product availability and updates inventory quantities accordingly.
Sales Record: Every purchase is logged into a json file, providing a detailed record of transactions.
Inventory Management: The system handles CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the inventory, allowing for dynamic management of products.

## Files
record.json: Contains all the inventory products.
sales2.csv: Stores all sales transactions made by the company.
Inventory Management with json.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook to facilitate purchasing products and generating invoices for customers.

## Usage
